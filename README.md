# Apllication Lifecycle Management

This tutorial goes over how the Carvel toolset addresses some of the problems frequently faced while managing and distributing applications buit on top of Kubernetes.

## Pre-requisites
- An active kubernetes cluster and kubectl to interact with cluster resources.
    - For this tutorial, a `minikube` cluster on your system works just fine. We can find installation instructions for the same [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). (Alternatives such as `kind` work just as well)
    - Installation instructions for `kubectl` can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)

Once set up, running
```bash
kubectl api-resources
```
Should list all available api-resources on the cluster. And we are good to go ðŸš€
If the user is on Windows we recommend using WSL.

## Setting up the Carvel tools
We will first install the Carvel CLI tools.
We can do this by running,
```bash
$ wget -O- https://carvel.dev/install.sh | bash
# or with curl...
$ curl -L https://carvel.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Alternatively if you prefer `brew`,
```bash
$ brew tap vmware-tanzu/carvel
$ brew install ytt kbld kapp imgpkg kwt vendir
```
should get us up and runnning with the tools.

We can now install kapp-controller on the cluster by running,
```bash
$ kapp deploy -a kc -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases/latest/download/release.yml
```
Confirm the changes to the cluster when you are prompted.

Once successful, the out put of kapp list should look something like this:
```bash
$ kapp list

Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.7:8443' (nodes: minikube)

If you have made it this far, we are good to get started with chapter-1!
